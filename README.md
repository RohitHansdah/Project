# Project
IIT Varanasi(B.H.U.) Project on Human Pose Estimation using Deep High-Resolution network .(semester 6 and semester 7)


:I am currently working on Human Pose Estimation with a focus on reliable
High-Resolution representations. Most existing methods recover high-resolution from low-resolution
networks my approach maintains the High-resolution throughout the process. The high-resolution
subnetwork is used as the first stage and gradually adding high-to-low resolutions subnets 1 by 1.
â€¢ Technology/Tools: Basic Machine Learning, HR-Net architecture, CNN's, COCO dataset
